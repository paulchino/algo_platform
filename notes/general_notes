1. json to bring in the data
2. show the questions and the text editor
	what info do i need?
	data id.
3. get the values of the input
	one button on the bottom

	the text editor have a data-id
	editor.getValue();


1. On page load you have json data that is passed to the view
	- The text editors are loaded with the data-id and the data-difficultly?
	- The place holders are placed inside the editors.

	// on client side
	- function that randomly selects the following
	the function 
	//JSON easy -> array, medium ->array, hard->array

		- 3 beginner
		- 1 intermediate
		- 1 hard

	and pushes it into an array?



2. the students provide the code
	
	var allQuestions have the list of all questions
	var input = allQuestions

	when student submits the form need to grab the 
	data-id of the text box and the code in the text box


	- What is created????
	An array of objects (for each question) is created. 

	On submittal Make this

	[
		{
			id: 1,
			input: function() { ...},
		},
		{
			id: 10,
			input: function() { ...}
		}
	]

	go through each array and eval each function




//----
check if array checks work
the studen input is an array. The json data must be turned into an array 

//--- have a type called function
test_cases: [[],[],[]]
test_output: [[],[],[]]
